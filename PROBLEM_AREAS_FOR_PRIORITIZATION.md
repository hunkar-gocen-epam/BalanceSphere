These can be demoed, measured, and shown working in Phase 1:

| # | Problem | Why It Wins |
|---|---------|-------------|
| **1.1** | Chronic workload | Calendar + Jira data exists; clear metrics |
| **1.3** | Working outside hours | Timestamps are easy to analyze; shocking visuals |

| **2.1** | Workload inequity | Comparative analysis is compelling; fairness narrative |
| **3.1** | Remote isolation | Meeting patterns + Slack gaps; universal pain point |
| **5.1** | PTO feels unsafe | Powerful story; Continuity Engine demo |
| **8.1** | Quiet quitting signals | Activity patterns; retention ROI story |

### 🥈 TIER 2: HIGH IMPACT + MEDIUM DETECTABILITY (Strong Narratives)
Harder to measure but emotionally resonant:

| # | Problem | Why It Matters |
|---|---------|----------------|
| **2.2** | Hidden workstreams | "Invisible work" is a powerful phrase |
| **2.3** | High performers carrying dysfunction | Hero story; fairness angle |
| **3.2** | Emotional invisibility | Core thesis of the pitch |

## 🎯 SUGGESTED PHASE 1 FOCUS (PICK 3-5)

For maximum Ideathon impact, focus on problems that:
1. ✅ Can be **visualized** (dashboard mockup)
2. ✅ Have **data sources** already available (calendar, Slack, Jira, HR)
3. ✅ Tell a **human story** (Arjun, Maria)
4. ✅ Show **prevention, not just detection**
5. ✅ Differentiate from "just another wellness app"

### 🏆 RECOMMENDED PHASE 1 BUNDLE:

| Problem | Solution Component | Demo Hook |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Working outside hours + Always-on** | AI Fairness Engine detects patterns | "Your Copilot knows you're coding at midnight. Now it cares." |
| **Workload inequity** | AI Fairness Engine shows imbalance | "Some people carry 3x the load. Make it visible." |
| **PTO feels unsafe** | AI Continuity Engine enables safe rest | "Vacation should be recovery, not dread." |
| **Remote isolation** | AI Connection Coach nudges managers | "When did you last really check in on your team?" |
| **Emotional invisibility** | Personal Orbit Index (POI) | "The project is Green. The person is Yellow." |

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM TEAM RESEARCH

### From Aliaksei:
- **Right to Disconnect** policy has 92% satisfaction rate
- **Async communication** breaks the instant-reply cycle
- **Output-based management** > input tracking
- Technology can **enforce** boundaries (Send Later, Inbox Pause)

### From Marin:
- **8 Pressure Types** model (Load, Cognitive, Boundary, Fairness, Visibility, Continuity, Social, Integration)
- **3 AI Engines** concept: Fairness, Continuity, Connection
- **"Supportive AI, not monitoring AI"** — critical trust principle
- Focus on **patterns, not policing**

### From Oleg:
- **Behavioral signals** are rich: message timing, emoji usage, meeting patterns
- **Multi-stage detection**: Burnout → Turnover → Onboarding → Overload
- **Data sources matrix** with invasiveness ratings
- **RM manager as signal source** — often overlooked

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

1. **Team call**: Use the prioritization matrix above
2. **Pick 3-5 problems** for Phase 1 demo
3. **Map to AI Engines**: Which problems → which engine?
4. **Refine stories**: Arjun, Maria, + new personas from Oleg's patterns
5. **Update pitch deck** with prioritized focus
