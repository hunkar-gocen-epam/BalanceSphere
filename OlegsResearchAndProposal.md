Emotional and Psychological States
Anxiety and stress — increased workload, uncertainty, fear of making mistakes. Manifests in hypercontrol, frequent double-checking, decision avoidance.
Apathy and demotivation — loss of meaning in work, mechanical task completion without engagement. Often precedes burnout or resignation.
Frustration — accumulated irritation from obstacles, bureaucracy, injustice. Can result in conflicts or quiet sabotage.
Impostor syndrome — employee objectively performs well but feels incompetent. Affects initiative and willingness to take responsibility.
Loneliness and isolation — especially relevant for remote workers. Feeling disconnected from the team, lack of belonging.
Cynicism and disillusionment — loss of faith in the company, leadership, mission. Often contagious within the team.
Boredom and underutilization — work below competency level, lack of challenges. Leads to job searching or "quiet quitting."
Overload and loss of control — too many tasks, inability to prioritize, chronic crunch mode.

Formation of "cliques" — team division into factions, information barriers between them.
Workload imbalance — some overloaded, others underutilized, creating tension.
Toxic leadership — manager creates negative atmosphere but it's not visible from above.
Distrust in leadership — team doesn't believe in management decisions, perceives them as unfair.

Organizational and Contextual Triggers
Reaction to changes — restructuring, strategy shift, new manager. Tracking adaptation.
Onboarding stress — state of new employees in the first 90 days, early attrition risk.
Return from vacation/sick leave/parental leave — readaptation, possible loss of context.
Seasonality — winter depression, pre-holiday stress, post-vacation syndrome.
Impact of external events — economic instability, political events, pandemics. How external context affects the team.

Physical and Lifestyle Indicators (if data available)
Sleep disruptions — late commits, emails at 3 AM, mentions of insomnia.
Lack of breaks — working without pauses, skipping lunches, no vacations taken.
Frequent sick leaves — can indicate both physical problems and psychosomatic issues.
Stage 1.
1. Burnout and Pre-burnout
Passive Signals (without employee participation)
From work calendars
•	Number of meetings per day/week and growth trend
•	Lack of free slots, calendar "overload"
•	Meetings outside working hours, early mornings, late evenings
•	Ratio of focused time vs. meeting time
From task trackers (Jira, Asana, Linear)
•	Growth in number of tasks in progress simultaneously
•	Increased completion time for typical tasks
•	Growth in reopened tasks, bugs, returns
•	Decreased throughput while workload remains constant
From communications (Slack, Teams, email)
•	Message send times — shift to night hours, weekends
•	Change in response patterns — delays or conversely instant responses (hypercontrol)
•	Shortened message length, formalization of tone
•	Decreased participation in informal channels
•	Reduced use of emojis, reactions (yes, this correlates)
From HR systems
•	Unused vacation days, accumulated time off
•	Frequent short sick leaves
•	Overtime according to time tracking data
From RM manager
•	Lack of motivation
•	Lack of energy
Micro-surveys (pulse surveys)
•	2-3 questions once a week or two
•	Energy/exhaustion scale
•	"How much do you feel in control of your work?"
•	"Do you have time for recovery?"
Check-in bot
•	Short dialogue every few days
•	Tracking response dynamics, not just absolute values
•	Ability for employee to flag "things are tough right now"
Self-assessment tools
•	Periodic completion of validated questionnaires (MBI-GS, Copenhagen Burnout Inventory)
•	Comparison with own previous results

2. Turnover Risk
Passive Signals
Behavioral changes
•	Decreased overall activity in work systems
•	Reduced initiation of communications (only responds, doesn't initiate)
•	Reduced participation in long-term projects
•	Declining mentorship, training newcomers
Calendar patterns
•	Appearance of regular "personal" blocks during work hours (interviews)
•	Cancellation or skipping 1-on-1s with manager
•	Reduced participation in strategic meetings
From work systems
•	Fewer comments in documents, code reviews
•	Declining documentation quality ("why bother, I'm leaving anyway")
•	Knowledge transfer without explicit request
HR data as context
•	Time since last promotion
•	Time in current role
•	Recent team changes (close colleague left, manager changed)
•	Results of last performance review

From RM manager
•	
Active Signals
Pulse surveys with the right questions
•	"Do you see yourself at the company in a year?"
•	"Would you recommend the company to a friend?" (eNPS)
•	"How well does your work align with your career goals?"
Stay interviews
•	Structured conversations about what keeps them and what concerns them
•	Part can be automated through a bot
Sentiment analysis in open responses
•	Change in tone in surveys, retrospectives
•	Growth of negative or neutrally-detached phrasing

3. Onboarding Stress and Early Attrition
Passive Signals
Activity in first weeks
•	Speed of getting access and starting work
•	Number of questions asked (too few = lost, too many = overwhelmed)
•	Participation in onboarding activities
Social integration
•	Who they communicate with and how often
•	Whether their contact circle expands beyond buddy/manager
•	Participation in informal channels and activities
Workload
•	Workload alignment with expectations for a newcomer
•	Speed of completing first tasks
•	Presence of blockers and resolution time

From RM manager
•	
Active Signals
Structured check-ins
•	Day 7, 30, 60, 90 — short surveys
•	"Do you understand what's expected of you?"
•	"Do you have everything you need to do your job?"
•	"Do you feel supported by the team?"
Expectation comparison
•	What was promised in the interview vs. reality
•	This is a common reason for early departure
Buddy/mentor feedback
•	The other side — how the buddy assesses adaptation

4. Overload and Workload Imbalance
Passive Signals
Objective workload metrics
•	Number of tasks in progress
•	Number of hours in meetings

Work patterns
•	Working outside business hours (evenings, weekends)
•	No breaks between meetings

•	Missed deadlines
•	Requests for help or conversely refusal to delegate

•	
Active Signals
Pulse questions
•	"Are you managing to handle your current workload?"
