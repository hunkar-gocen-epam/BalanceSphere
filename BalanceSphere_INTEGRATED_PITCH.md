## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### 🔥 The Disconnect Paradox

**Header:** "EPAM has world-class tools. None of them talk to each other about YOU."

**The Reality:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    YOUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  📊 TELESCOPE        → Knows your skills & career goals         │
│  📡 RADAR            → Knows project health & team dynamics     │
│  👥 PEOPLE           → Knows your profile & org structure       │
│  📋 STAFFING         → Knows your availability & assignments    │
│  💰 COMPENSATION     → Knows your salary & benefits             │
│  🤖 DIAL/ELITEA      → Can analyze patterns & predict needs     │
│  💻 Copilot/Codemie  → Sees your daily work patterns            │
│                                                                 │
│         ❌ BUT NONE OF THEM ASK: "ARE YOU OKAY?"                │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Human Cost:**
- Staffing assigns you to a 3rd consecutive high-stress project — **doesn't know** you're exhausted
- Telescope shows a skill gap — **doesn't know** you're too burned out to learn
- Radar flags project risk — **doesn't connect it** to team wellbeing
- You use Copilot at 11 PM every night — **nobody notices** the pattern

**The Insight:**
> *"We have the data. We have the AI. We just haven't connected them to the question that matters most: How are our people actually doing?"*

**The Three Balanced Pillars:**

| Pillar | What It Tracks | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **🌿 VITALITY** | Energy, stress, recovery patterns | Physical & mental health |
| **🌍 MOBILITY** | Location needs, family proximity, timezone strain | Life flexibility |
| **🛡️ STABILITY** | Career growth, skill development, sense of security | Long-term wellbeing |

*Note: We renamed "Prosperity" to "Stability" — less financial, more holistic.*

## SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS (EPAM AI Integration)

### ⚙️ Built on EPAM's AI Backbone

**Header:** "Your AI assistants become your wellbeing allies."

**Integration Map:**

### 🤖 DIAL & ELITEA Integration
| Current Use | BalanceSphere Enhancement |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| General AI queries | **Wellbeing-aware responses** |
| Task assistance | **"I notice you've been working late. Want me to draft a workload discussion email for your manager?"** |
| Information retrieval | **Proactive nudges:** "Your POI suggests you need recovery. Here are available PTO slots." |

**Example ELITEA Prompt Enhancement:**
```
USER: "Help me prepare for tomorrow's client call"

STANDARD ELITEA: [Gives prep materials]

BALANCESPHERE-ENHANCED ELITEA: 
"Here's your prep. I also noticed you've had 3 client calls 
this week and your calendar shows no breaks. Would you like 
me to suggest a 15-min buffer before this call, or draft a 
message to reschedule your 4pm meeting?"
```

### 💻 GitHub Copilot / Codemie / Cursor Integration
| Signal | Wellbeing Insight |
|--------|------------------|
| Coding at unusual hours (11 PM - 2 AM) | Potential overwork flag |
| Decreased commit frequency | Possible disengagement or burnout |
| Increased error rates | Fatigue indicator |
| Long debugging sessions | Frustration/stress signal |

**How It Works:**
- BalanceSphere receives **anonymized, aggregated patterns** (not code content)
- Patterns feed into POI calculation
- If concerning patterns emerge, system suggests interventions

**Privacy First:** No code is read. Only metadata (timestamps, session length, error frequency) is analyzed — and only with employee opt-in.

### 📊 Telescope Integration
| Current Use | BalanceSphere Enhancement |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Skills tracking | **Add "Energy for Learning" metric** |
| Career goals | **Factor current stress into growth recommendations** |
| Development plans | **"You want to learn Cloud Architecture, but your POI shows high stress. Let's schedule this for Q2 when your project load lightens."** |

### 📡 Radar Integration
| Current Use | BalanceSphere Enhancement |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Project health metrics | **Add "Team Vitality Score"** |
| Risk indicators | **"This project is Yellow risk AND team POI is declining — intervention needed"** |
| Delivery tracking | **Connect delivery pressure to human cost** |

### 📋 Staffing Integration (THE KEY CONNECTION)
| Current Use | BalanceSphere Enhancement |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Availability matching | **POI-Aware Staffing** |
| Skill matching | **Add "Sustainable Capacity" filter** |
| Project assignment | **"This person is available and skilled, but has been on 3 high-stress projects. Suggest recovery assignment or bench time."** |

**The Staffing Algorithm Upgrade:**
```
CURRENT STAFFING LOGIC:
  Match = Skills + Availability + Location

BALANCESPHERE STAFFING LOGIC:
  Match = Skills + Availability + Location + POI Score
  
  IF POI < 40 (stressed):
    → Flag for manager review
    → Suggest lighter project or recovery time
    → Offer "Vitality TimeBank" credits
```

### 👥 People Portal Integration
| Current Use | BalanceSphere Enhancement |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Profile management | **Add private "My Wellbeing Dashboard"** |
| Org structure | **Manager view: "Team Vitality Overview"** |
| Recognition | **"Sustainable Performer" badges** |

---

## SLIDE 5: THE THREE PILLARS IN ACTION

### 🌿 VITALITY (Health & Energy)

**Features:**
1. **Vitality TimeBank**
   - Overtime hours → Recovery credits (automatic)
   - Manager dashboard shows team "energy debt"
   - Integration: Pulls hours from Staffing/Timesheets

2. **Recovery Nudges via ELITEA**
   - AI notices patterns → Suggests breaks, PTO, resources
   - "You've declined 3 lunch invites this week. Social connection helps wellbeing. Want me to find a virtual coffee chat?"

3. **Sustainable Delivery Recognition**
   - Teams that deliver without burnout get highlighted
   - Radar integration: "Project X delivered on-time with healthy team score"

---

### 🌍 MOBILITY (Location & Life Flexibility)

**Features:**
1. **Life Stage Kanban**
   - Employees signal life changes (new parent, caring for elders, relocation interest)
   - Staffing sees this when assigning projects
   - "Maria flagged 'Caring for Parents' — prioritize EU timezone projects"

2. **Timezone Strain Tracker**
   - Calculates meeting load across timezones
   - Alerts when someone has unsustainable overlap hours
   - Integration: Calendar analysis via DIAL

3. **Mobility Explorer (Lighter Version)**
   - Shows open roles in different locations
   - Basic cost-of-living context (not heavy financial modeling)
   - "Interested in Gdańsk? Here are 4 open roles matching your skills."

---

### 🛡️ STABILITY (Growth & Security)

**Features:**
1. **Growth-Ready Indicator**
   - Telescope + POI integration
   - "You want to grow into Solution Architecture. Your current POI suggests waiting 2 months for the certification push."
   - Prevents skill development from becoming another stressor

2. **Career Conversation Prompts**
   - ELITEA helps managers have wellbeing-aware 1:1s
   - "Your direct report's POI has declined. Here are talking points for your next 1:1."

3. **Benefit Awareness**
   - Many employees don't know what support exists
   - ELITEA integration: "Did you know EPAM offers 5 free therapy sessions? Based on your recent patterns, this might help."

---

## SLIDE 6: HERO USE CASES

### Use Case 1: "The Early Warning" — Arjun's Story

**The Situation:**
- Arjun is a senior developer, 8 months into a demanding project
- He's been coding until midnight (Copilot sees the timestamps)
- He's declined 4 team social events (Calendar analysis)
- His Radar shows project is "Green" — delivery is fine

**Without BalanceSphere:**
- Project delivers successfully
- Arjun quits 2 months later citing "burnout"
- Manager is blindsided: "But the project was going great!"

**With BalanceSphere:**
1. **Copilot patterns** feed into POI → Flags declining vitality
2. **ELITEA** proactively messages Arjun: "I noticed some late nights. Here are your Recovery Credits — you have 2 days available."
3. **Staffing dashboard** shows manager: "Arjun's POI is declining. Consider workload adjustment."
4. **Manager acts** — redistributes tasks, Arjun takes 2 recovery days
5. **Project still delivers** — AND Arjun stays at EPAM

**The Insight:**
> "The project was Green. But the person was Yellow. BalanceSphere sees both."

---

### Use Case 2: "The Life Transition" — Maria's Story

**The Situation:**
- Maria is a PM in London, parents aging in Poland
- She's been researching Gdańsk roles on her own
- She hasn't told anyone because she fears "looking uncommitted"

**Without BalanceSphere:**
- Maria suffers in silence
- Eventually takes an external offer in Poland
- EPAM loses a great PM

**With BalanceSphere:**
1. **Maria updates her Life Stage Kanban** → "Caring for Family — Open to Relocation"
2. **Staffing sees the flag** → Surfaces relevant Gdańsk opportunities
3. **Mobility Explorer** shows her open roles + timezone compatibility
4. **ELITEA helps** → "Want me to draft a message to your manager about relocation interest?"
5. **Maria moves internally** → Stays at EPAM, closer to parents

**The Insight:**
> "Maria didn't need a higher salary. She needed someone to ask: 'What does your life need right now?'"

---

### Use Case 3: "The Team Shield" — Manager's View

**The Situation:**
- A delivery manager has 12 people across 3 projects
- One project is in crunch mode for 3 weeks

**Without BalanceSphere:**
- Manager focuses on delivery metrics
- Doesn't realize 4 team members are exhausted
- Post-delivery: 2 people ask for transfers, 1 goes on medical leave

**With BalanceSphere:**
1. **Manager Dashboard** shows "Team Vitality Score" alongside Radar metrics
2. **Alert:** "3 team members' POI declining — sustainable delivery at risk"
3. **Suggested actions:** Redistribute load, activate TimeBank credits, schedule recovery
4. **Post-delivery:** Team is tired but intact, recognized for "Sustainable Delivery"

**The Insight:**
> "The best managers want to protect their teams. They just need the data to do it."

---

## SLIDE 8: THE TEAM & CALL TO ACTION

### 👥 Who We Are — Team BalanceSphere

| Name | Role | Contribution |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Hunkar Gocen** | Senior Manager, Data & Analytics | Data strategy, POI algorithm design, analytics vision |
| **Oleg Sidorenko** | Data Solution Architect | System architecture, AI/ML integration, technical feasibility |
| **Aliaksei Babuk** | Cloud Engineering Manager | Infrastructure design, EPAM tool integration, scalability |
| **Marin Komadina** | Senior Delivery Manager | Delivery perspective, implementation roadmap, change management |

### 💬 Why This Matters to Us

> "We're not outside consultants designing a theoretical system. We're EPAM employees who USE Telescope, Staffing, DIAL every day. We know where the gaps are because we've felt them. BalanceSphere isn't about adding another tool — it's about making the tools we already have actually see us as whole people."

### 🎯 The Ask

**We're not asking EPAM to build something new.**
**We're asking EPAM to connect what it already has — to a human purpose.**

> "Your tools already know you're struggling. Let's teach them to help."

# 🎬 REVISED VIDEO SCRIPT (3 Minutes)

---

### [0:00 - 0:20] OPENING HOOK

**Visual:** Screen recording montage — Telescope, Staffing, Radar, DIAL, Copilot — all the tools an EPAM employee uses daily.

**Voiceover:**
> "Look at all these tools. Telescope knows your skills. Staffing knows your availability. Radar tracks your project. DIAL answers your questions. Copilot helps you code. These systems know more about your work life than your best friend. But here's the thing... (pause) None of them know if you're okay."

---

### [0:20 - 0:50] THE PROBLEM

**Visual:** Split screen — "System View" (all green dashboards) vs. "Human View" (exhausted person at 11 PM)

**Voiceover:**
> "The project is Green. The employee is burning out. The staffing algorithm says you're 'available.' It doesn't say you've been available for 3 intense projects in a row. DIAL can answer any question you ask. But it never asks: 'Hey, I noticed you're working late again — are you okay?'"

**Visual:** The three pillars floating separately: Health, Location, Stability

> "We track skills. We track projects. We track locations. But we don't connect them to the question that matters: How is this person actually doing?"

---

### [0:50 - 1:30] THE SOLUTION

**Visual:** The three pillars merge into the BalanceSphere logo. Integration diagram appears.

**Voiceover:**
> "Introducing BalanceSphere OS. Not another app. A wellbeing intelligence layer that connects the tools you already use."

**Visual:** POI dashboard mockup

> "The Personal Orbit Index brings together signals from across your digital footprint — work patterns, calendar load, project intensity — into one holistic view. YOU control what's shared. YOU see the full picture."

**Visual:** ELITEA chat interface with wellbeing-aware response

> "Your AI assistants become wellbeing allies. ELITEA doesn't just answer questions — it notices patterns. 'I see you've had back-to-back meetings for 3 days. Want me to block some focus time?'"

**Visual:** Staffing interface with POI indicator

> "And here's the systemic change: when staffing assigns projects, they don't just see your skills. They see your capacity. Not just 'Is this person available?' but 'Is this person ready?'"

---

### [1:30 - 2:10] THE HUMAN STORIES

**Visual:** Illustrated "Arjun" character

**Voiceover:**
> "Meet Arjun. His project dashboard is green. But his POI is yellow. He's been coding until midnight — Copilot sees the timestamps. He's skipped team lunches — the calendar knows."

**Visual:** Manager gets an alert

> "With BalanceSphere, his manager gets a gentle alert. Not 'Arjun is failing.' Just: 'Arjun might need support.' The manager checks in. Workload adjusts. Project still delivers. Arjun stays."

**Visual:** "Maria" character looking at Mobility Explorer

> "Meet Maria. Her parents need her in Poland, but she's afraid to ask about relocation. With BalanceSphere, she can signal her life stage privately. Staffing surfaces Gdańsk opportunities. ELITEA helps her draft the conversation. She moves internally — instead of leaving."

---

### [2:10 - 2:45] THE IMPACT

**Visual:** Key metrics appearing

**Voiceover:**
> "The impact? Managers who can finally see their team's human reality. Employees who feel seen as whole people. A company that doesn't just measure performance — but sustains it."

**Visual:** Privacy firewall diagram

> "And we do it with privacy at the core. Employees own their data. Managers see team patterns, not individual surveillance. This isn't Big Brother. It's Big Support."

---

### [2:45 - 3:00] THE CLOSE

**Visual:** All EPAM tool logos flowing into BalanceSphere

**Voiceover:**
> "EPAM has world-class tools. World-class AI. World-class people. BalanceSphere connects them — with a human purpose."

**Text on Screen:**
> "Your tools already know you're struggling. Let's teach them to help."

**Final Frame:**
> **BalanceSphere OS**
> *Vitality. Mobility. Stability.*
> *Built on the tools we already trust.*
> **Team BalanceSphere**
> Hunkar Gocen • Oleg Sidorenko • Aliaksei Babuk • Marin Komadina
