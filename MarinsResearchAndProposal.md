EPAM Mental Health & Wellbeing Proposal
Version 1.0 – December 2025

1. Why We Are Doing This
EPAM operates in a highly distributed, high-pressure, multi-regional environment. People work across time zones, incomplete structures, unclear expectations, and invisible workstreams.

Across our teams, we see repeating patterns:
- Chronic workload and multitasking
- Emotional invisibility in remote settings
- Fragmented work, blurred boundaries
- Unfair workload distribution
- Loss of human connection
- Regional stress (financial, relocation, isolation)
- Inefficient tooling
- High performers silently carrying structural dysfunction

Our goal is to build a wellbeing layer that makes distributed work sustainable, with clear visibility, fairness, and human connection — without becoming surveillance.

2. Problem Statement (Final Integrated Version)
EPAM’s remote, distributed model creates a multi-layer mental-health risk: persistent overload, blurred boundaries, hidden workstreams, emotional invisibility, and uneven workload distribution(inequity), belonging, psychological safety, and cultural fragmentation.People cannot disconnect safely, transitions destabilize teams, and high performers absorb silent structural dysfunction. Remote employees lose human connection, belonging, recognition, and identity. Regional pressures amplify this strain.

We need a human-centric wellbeing layer that restores fairness, visibility, continuity, and connection — powered by supportive AI, not monitoring AI.
3. The EPAM Pressure Stack (Final Model v4)
This combines Deloitte, McKinsey, WHO, OECD, and your own team’s insights.
1. Load Pressure
High workload, multitasking, constant switching, unrealistic timelines.
2. Cognitive Pressure
Fragmented work, chaotic coordination, difficulty focusing.
3. Boundary Pressure
PTO feels unsafe; people fear things collapsing in their absence.
4. Fairness Pressure
Uneven task distribution, silent overperformance, low accountability.
5. Visibility Pressure
Hidden workstreams, emotional invisibility, lack of recognition.
6. Continuity Pressure
Transitions (vacation, maternity, attrition, relocation) disrupt teams.
7. Social Pressure
Remote isolation, loss of physical presence, lack of belonging.
8. Integration Pressure
Life and work cannot be blended; outdated 9–5 assumptions create guilt and burnout.

6. Solution Concept: EPAM’s Human-Centric Wellbeing Layer
A modular, region-adaptive, AI-supported wellbeing system that:
1.	Restores fairness — makes invisible work visible, balances workloads
2.	Restores continuity — stabilizes transitions, protects PTO
3.	Restores connection — detects isolation and nudges human contact
4.	Restores autonomy — supports work–life integration
5.	Restores psychological safety — no surveillance, only support

7. Three Core Components
________________________________________
1. AI Fairness Engine
Neutral, pattern-based support (never individual monitoring):
•	Detects repeating overload patterns
•	Surfaces hidden workstreams (presales, mentoring, firefighting)
•	Highlights follow-through gaps across teams
•	Shows managers workload imbalances and risk flags
•	Supports fair delegation
Goal: Reduce workload inequity → reduce burnout.

1. What the AI Fairness Engine is for
The AI Fairness Engine is a neutral assistant that surfaces workload and contribution imbalances so teams can share work more fairly, protect high performers, and prevent burnout — without spying on individuals.
It does not:
•	measure keystrokes
•	rank people
•	feed performance reviews
It does:
•	detect patterns of who carries more, who is constantly firefighting, who gets the worst shifts, who is always pulled into “extra” work
•	highlight situations where someone is quietly drowning or others are quietly disengaging
•	give managers objective hints instead of gossip-based stories

2. Design Principles 
To keep this psychologically safe and not dystopian:
1.	Pattern, not policing
o	Focus on trends & aggregates, not “gotcha” events (“Marin replied late once”).
2.	Assistive, not authoritative
o	It suggests: “Looks like X is overloaded,” not: “X is failing, reassign them.”
3.	Opt-in & transparent
o	People know: what is tracked, how it’s used, what is not used (e.g., not for performance ratings).
4.	Context-aware
o	Takes into account role, seniority, project type, region—not naive averages.
5.	Data-minimal
o	Uses metadata (timestamps, count of tasks, number of follow-ups, etc.) far more than content.
6.	Human-in-the-loop
o	Manager and team decide what to act on; AI never auto-escalates to HR.

2. AI Continuity Engine
Inspired by “AI Vacation Assistant”:
•	Prepares handoff summaries
•	Reminds meeting attendees with context
•	Logs decisions during absence
•	Highlights dependencies before PTO
•	Helps structure transitions (parental leave, retirement, regional relocation)
Goal: Make rest safe again.

AI Continuity Engine – Deep Design Blueprint
1. What the Continuity Engine is for
Short version:
The AI Continuity Engine protects humans from chaos when they disconnect — by ensuring work keeps flowing, handoffs are clean, dependencies are visible, and return-to-work is smooth.
It is the antidote to:
•	“I can’t take PTO, everything will fall apart.”
•	“Nobody knows what I was working on.”
•	“I’ll return to 400 emails and 20 fires.”
•	“I cannot go on parental leave; no one can replace me.”
•	“If I relocate, I’ll lose project continuity.”
The mental health impact is massive:
•	reduced anxiety,
•	safer boundaries,
•	actual rest.
________________________________________
2. Design Principles (the nondystopian version)
To keep trust high and fear low:
1.	No new tasks are created — it organizes what already exists.
2.	Uses metadata, not content, unless the user explicitly shares.
3.	Runs only when the employee activates it (“I’m going on leave”).
4.	Always shows the user what it will share.
5.	Never acts as a manager or HR spy.
6.	Focuses on continuity, not performance judgment.
7.	Acts like the world’s best project coordinator — not a boss.

3. AI Connection Coach
Not monitoring people — supporting leaders.
•	Nudges managers to check in on isolated individuals
•	Suggests deeper 1:1 questions
•	Highlights people with low visibility + high output
•	Encourages human presence over task supervision
•	Promotes trust, empathy, and accessibility
Goal: Reduce emotional invisibility → increase belonging.

AI CONNECTION COACH — Full System Design Blueprint
(Human Presence. Emotional Visibility. Social Health at Scale.)
________________________________________
1. What the AI Connection Coach Is For
The AI Connection Coach rebuilds human connection in distributed teams by detecting isolation, enabling meaningful manager–employee touchpoints, strengthening relationships, and restoring emotional visibility — without surveillance.
Remote work breaks the “micro-interactions” that create belonging:
•	hallway chats
•	visual recognition
•	emotional cues
•	being seen
The Connection Coach reconstructs this — digitally and safely.
________________________________________
2. The Psychology Behind It 
•	Isolation is the #1 predictor of burnout in remote teams.
•	Humans need recognition + presence signals to stay engaged.
•	Emotional invisibility kills motivation, identity, and performance.
•	High performers quit because nobody sees their hidden work.
So the coach addresses:
1.	Isolation
2.	Belonging
3.	Recognition
4.	Human presence
5.	Communication gaps
6.	Leader emotional competence
________________________________________
3. Design Principles (to avoid “AI buddy” creepiness)
1.	Facilitates connection — does NOT simulate friendship.
It connects humans, does not replace them.
2.	Signal-based — never infers emotions from text or webcams.
Uses:
o	meeting patterns
o	reduced interactions
o	skipped events
o	manager–employee gaps
o	isolation signals
3.	Supportive, not evaluative.
No judgment, no scores for emotional health.
4.	Visible, transparent, and opt-in.
The employee chooses how much interpersonal data is used.
5.	Non-diagnostic, non-therapeutic.
We do not “interpret mental health” — we “interpret connection patterns.”
==============================
