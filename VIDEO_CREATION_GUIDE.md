### 🔥 **MASTER PROMPT FOR SYNTHESIA**

```
Create a 3-minute professional business pitch video for "PULSE - The Invisible Safety Net" - an AI wellbeing companion for distributed teams at EPAM.

**Video Structure (10 scenes):**

---

**SCENE 1: OPENING HOOK (0:00-0:20)**

Visual Style: Professional, slightly dramatic
Avatar: Business professional (confident, empathetic)
Tone: Intriguing, sets up tension

Script:
"Look at this dashboard. [PAUSE] Project status: Green. Sprint velocity: On track. Client satisfaction: High. Skills updated. PTO balance available. Everything looks perfect.

[DRAMATIC PAUSE - show exhausted person at laptop, clock showing 1:47 AM]

But what about the person behind the dashboard?

[TEXT OVERLAY APPEARS]
'The project was Green. The person was Yellow.'"

Visual Elements Needed:
- Montage of dashboard screenshots: RADAR, JIRA, Staffing, Telescope, People Portal (all showing green checkmarks)
- Transition to: Person working late at laptop, exhausted
- Text overlay: "The project was Green. The person was Yellow."

---

**SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:20-0:50)**

Visual Style: Documentary-style, empathetic
Avatar: Same, more conversational

Script:
"EPAM employees face eight invisible pressures every day:

Workload that nobody sees.
Boundaries that blur between life and work.
Vacations that feel unsafe to take.
Isolation in distributed teams.
Hidden contributions that go unrecognized.
Context-switching that fragments our minds.
The guilt of flexibility.
And the fear that asking for help means admitting weakness.

[PAUSE]

Our tools know everything about our work. Calendar sees the 45-hour meeting weeks. Copilot sees the 1 AM commits. Slack sees the weekend messages. But they know nothing about US.

The data exists. The signals are there. We just never connected them to the question that matters:

[PAUSE, EMPHATIC]

How is this person actually doing?"

Visual Elements Needed:
- Animated icons for 8 pressures (🔥🧠🚧⚖️👻🔄🏝️🔀)
- Floating tool logos: Calendar, Slack, JIRA, GitHub, Copilot - appearing disconnected
- Transition: All tools converging with a question mark
- Text: "How is this person actually doing?"

---

**SCENE 3: THE SOLUTION - INTRODUCING PULSE (0:50-1:10)**

Visual Style: Modern, hopeful, tech-forward
Avatar: Excited but professional

Script:
"Introducing PULSE.

Not another dashboard you forget to visit.
Not another portal to check.
Not surveillance.

PULSE is your personal AI companion that lives in Microsoft Teams — where you already work — and reaches out when it sees you're struggling.

[PAUSE]

Before you have to ask.
Before you hit the wall.
Before your manager notices you're gone."

Visual Elements Needed:
- Microsoft Teams interface appears
- PULSE bot icon animates in
- Show floating notification bubble with caring message
- Text: "A colleague that actually notices"

---

**SCENE 4: HOW IT WORKS - THE THREE ENGINES (1:10-1:30)**

Visual Style: Tech explainer, clean diagrams
Avatar: Educational tone

Script:
"PULSE has three engines that work together:

The LOAD Engine reads signals from your calendar, your commit history, your meeting patterns. It notices when you're drowning — and offers help. 'Want me to block focus time? Draft a conversation starter for your manager?'

The REST Engine is your AI vacation assistant. It prepares handoffs before you leave, protects your inbox while you're gone, and briefs you in five minutes when you return. No more dreading vacation.

The BOND Engine catches isolation before it becomes loneliness. It surfaces the kudos you missed, the connections you could make, the coffees worth having.

PULSE doesn't just alert. It helps."

Visual Elements Needed:
- Three engine icons appear sequentially:
  1. 🔥 LOAD - with calendar/code examples
  2. 🛡️ REST - with vacation/inbox visuals
  3. 💚 BOND - with connection/chat bubbles
- Show brief Teams chat examples for each
- Architecture diagram: Teams → PULSE → Data sources

---

**SCENE 5: HERO STORY - ARJUN (1:30-1:50)**

Visual Style: Story mode, intimate, real
Avatar: Storytelling mode, empathetic

Script:
"Meet Arjun. 

His project dashboard is green. Velocity is healthy. Client is happy.

But PULSE sees what the dashboards don't:

The 1 AM commits in Copilot.
The 45 hours of meetings in Calendar.
The five declined team events.
The six weeks since his last real one-on-one.

[PAUSE]

PULSE reaches out. 'Hi Arjun, I noticed some patterns. Your PULSE score is 67 — elevated for three weeks. Want to explore options?'

[TRANSITION]

PULSE doesn't stop at alerting. It offers:
'Block two hours of focus time tomorrow?'
'Draft a workload message for your PM?'
'Use a Recovery Credit?'

Arjun's manager gets a gentle, anonymous nudge: 'One team member showing elevated signals. Time for deeper check-ins.'

[PAUSE]

They have a real conversation. Workload shifts. Arjun takes three recovery days.

[BEAT]

Eight months later? Project delivers. Arjun stays. He's leading the next one."

Visual Elements Needed:
- Teams chat showing PULSE message to Arjun
- PULSE score: 67/100 (yellow)
- Options buttons: [Block Focus Time] [Draft Message] [Recovery]
- Split screen: Without PULSE (resignation) vs With PULSE (success)
- Timeline visual showing intervention at Month 6

---

**SCENE 6: HERO STORY - MARIA (1:50-2:10)**

Visual Style: Warm, vacation vibes → relief
Avatar: Storytelling continues

Script:
"Meet Maria.

She has fifteen unused PTO days. Not because she doesn't need rest. Because last time she took vacation, she returned to four hundred emails, three missed escalations, and two angry clients.

[PAUSE]

Maria fears her own vacation.

[TRANSITION - HOPEFUL TONE]

With PULSE's REST Engine:

Before she leaves, PULSE scans her calendar, identifies dependencies, and generates a handoff doc for her backup, Oleg. Stakeholders are notified automatically: 'Maria OOO Dec 15-22. Context attached.'

While she's in Poland with her parents, PULSE logs decisions made without her and batches non-urgent emails. 127 emails become 4 flagged priorities.

When she returns, PULSE has a five-minute brief waiting: 'Two decisions made. Three kudos you received. One client question. Nothing's on fire.'

[PAUSE]

Maria is caught up by 10 AM.

[BEAT]

More importantly? She books another vacation in March."

Visual Elements Needed:
- Maria at laptop, stressed, vacation days shown: 15 unused
- Transition: PULSE preparing handoff document
- Vacation scene: Maria relaxed (phone away)
- Return scene: "5-min briefing" interface, clean inbox
- Happy Maria booking next vacation

---

**SCENE 7: THE IMPACT - METRICS (2:10-2:25)**

Visual Style: Data-driven, confident
Avatar: Professional, excited about results

Script:
"The impact?

Thirty percent reduction in burnout-related attrition.
Forty percent increase in PTO actually used.
Fifty percent improvement in manager effectiveness on wellbeing.

That's not just better culture. That's two to four million dollars saved per thousand employees.

First-year ROI? Ten X."

Visual Elements Needed:
- Animated metrics appearing:
  - "-30% Burnout Attrition"
  - "+40% PTO Utilization"  
  - "+50% Manager Effectiveness"
  - "$2-4M Saved / 1,000 employees"

---

**SCENE 8: PRIVACY & TRUST (2:25-2:35)**

Visual Style: Secure, trustworthy, transparent
Avatar: Serious, builds trust

Script:
"And we do it with privacy at the core.

You see everything about yourself. Your full PULSE breakdown. Every signal. Full control over what's shared.

Your manager? They see team patterns only. 'One team member elevated' — never names. Never surveillance. Never gotchas.

[EMPHATIC]

This isn't Big Brother. This is care."

Visual Elements Needed:
- Privacy firewall diagram:
  - Employee side: Full visibility, full control
  - Manager side: Aggregated patterns only, no names

Visual Style: Technical confidence, already possible
Avatar: Matter-of-fact, confident

Script:
"And it's built on what we already have.

Microsoft Teams. DIAL and ELITEA — EPAM's own AI. Staffing. Telescope. People Portal. Radar. Vacation. Time Portal. Calendar. Copilot.

No new surveillance. No new data collection. Just a new lens:

A human lens."

Avatar: Direct to camera, heartfelt

Script:
"Imagine if someone at work actually noticed you were struggling.

[PAUSE]

And said something.

[LONGER PAUSE]

That's PULSE.

[FINAL BEAT]

Your tools already know you're struggling.

Let's teach them to care."
