SCENE 1: THE HOOK (0:00-0:20)
Visual: Split screen composition. LEFT: Multiple computer monitors showing enterprise dashboards (JIRA, Calendar, Project Management) with green checkmarks and positive metrics. Clean, professional office setting with soft blue lighting. RIGHT: Dramatic contrast - exhausted software developer working alone at laptop in dark home office at 1:47 AM, lit only by screen glow, coffee cups scattered, slumped posture. Camera slowly pushes in on both scenes simultaneously.

Text Overlay (0:15): Large bold text fades in between the two scenes: "The project was Green. The person was Yellow."

Mood: Intriguing opening that creates tension and recognition. Professional but concerning.

---

SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:20-0:50)
Visual: Fast-paced documentary-style montage showing distributed workers experiencing eight invisible pressures:
- Professional person juggling 4 video calls simultaneously on multiple screens
- Someone checking Slack messages in bed at midnight, blue screen glow on tired face
- Developer rapidly switching between 8 browser tabs, stressed expression
- Parent working during family dinner, guilty and conflicted
- Remote worker alone in apartment, no social interaction visible
- Calendar view showing 45 hours of meetings in one week, color-coded blocks overwhelming
- GitHub commits timestamps showing 1:00 AM, 2:30 AM pattern
- Unused vacation days counter: 15 days, never decreasing

Transition to: Abstract tech visualization - floating application logos (Microsoft Teams, Slack, JIRA, GitHub, Calendar, Outlook) in dark digital space, disconnected, spinning slowly. Each pulses with data but they don't connect. Camera weaves between them.

Final shot: Close-up of human face, concerned expression, warm lighting. Person looks at camera. Text overlay: "How is this person actually doing?" Background shifts from cold tech to warm human tones.

Mood: Building tension, relatable stress, systemic problem. Desaturated colors except final warm moment.

Voiceover: "EPAM has 16 systems tracking work. Zero systems watching people. Our tools know everything about our projects. Nothing about us."

---

SCENE 3: INTRODUCING PULSE (0:50-1:10)
Visual: Microsoft Teams interface appears on screen, clean professional UI. A friendly bot icon with heartbeat wave design (coral and teal colors) smoothly animates into the chat sidebar. The PULSE bot icon pulses gently like a heartbeat. A caring message notification appears: "Hi [Name], I've noticed some patterns worth checking in about..."

Over-the-shoulder shot of someone at desk receiving the PULSE message. We see their Teams screen displaying a wellbeing score (67/100 in amber/yellow color) with three key metrics in cards:
- 📅 38 hours of meetings (team avg: 25 hrs)
- 🌙 Activity after 9 PM on 4 nights
- 📋 8 tasks in progress simultaneously

The person's posture visibly relaxes as they read. Natural window lighting improves, suggesting hope. Three action buttons appear: [Let's Talk] [See Full Report] [Remind Me Later]

Mood: Hopeful, friendly, "someone noticed." Warm lighting begins to appear. Professional but caring.

Voiceover: "Introducing PULSE. Not another portal. Not surveillance. Your personal AI companion that lives in Microsoft Teams and reaches out when it sees you're struggling—before you have to ask."

---

SCENE 4: HOW IT WORKS (1:10-1:30)
Visual: Beautiful 3D animated visualization of three interconnected spheres floating in space:

LEFT SPHERE (LOAD Engine): Glows orange/red with fire icon 🔥. Calendar events and code commit data streams flow around it in orange particles. Shows workload monitoring.

CENTER SPHERE (REST Engine): Glows blue/cyan with shield icon 🛡️. Vacation calendar and inbox symbols orbit it. Shows vacation protection features.

RIGHT SPHERE (BOND Engine): Glows green with heart icon 💚. Connection lines between small people icons flow around it. Shows social connection monitoring.

All three spheres pulse in sync. Colorful data streams flow between them, showing integration. Clean corporate aesthetic, dark background makes spheres pop.

Transition to: Architectural diagram showing data flow from bottom (EPAM systems: Calendar, JIRA, Slack, GitHub, Copilot, Staffing, Radar logos) → middle (PULSE AI with DIAL/ELITEA) → top (Microsoft Teams interface where user interacts). Smooth animated data streams flowing upward.

Mood: Sophisticated, intelligent system. Corporate tech aesthetic. Confidence-building.

Voiceover: "PULSE has three engines. LOAD monitors your workload and offers proactive help. REST protects your vacation from chaos. BOND prevents isolation before it becomes loneliness. Built on tools EPAM already has."

---

SCENE 5: ARJUN'S STORY (1:30-1:50)
Visual Sequence:

SHOT 1 (Before): Split screen - LEFT shows green dashboards, RIGHT shows Arjun (30s, professional attire) working late, multiple monitors, exhausted, dark room lit only by screens. Desaturated colors, concerning mood.

SHOT 2 (Intervention): Close-up of Arjun's Teams screen showing PULSE message with his 67/100 score and caring check-in. His face reflected in screen shows tired → hopeful transition. Soft morning light begins entering frame. Warm color grading starts appearing.

SHOT 3 (Transformation Montage - 8 seconds):
- Arjun in 1-on-1 video call with manager, both smiling, real conversation happening
- His calendar view showing new green "Focus Time" blocks
- Arjun taking walk outside during day, phone off, relaxed, sunlight
- Title card: "8 months later"
- Arjun confidently presenting to team, leading meeting, thriving

Colors shift from cold desaturated → warm natural → vibrant and alive. Natural lighting throughout. Uplifting music swell.

Mood: Transformation from burnout risk → intervention → success. Emotional relief. Human thriving.

Voiceover: "Meet Arjun. His dashboards were green. But PULSE saw the pattern: 1 AM commits, 45-hour meeting weeks. It reached out. His manager was alerted anonymously. They talked. Workload shifted. Eight months later? Arjun's still here. Leading the next project."

---

SCENE 6: MARIA'S STORY (1:50-2:10)
Visual Sequence:

SHOT 1 (Fear): Maria (35, professional) at laptop, vacation request form on screen showing "15 unused PTO days." Her expression conflicted, mouse hovering over Submit button but doesn't click. Quick flash cuts to previous vacation return memory: inbox "400 unread," stressed face, chaos. She closes form without submitting. Moody lighting, slightly desaturated.

SHOT 2 (REST Engine): PULSE REST Engine interface animation in Teams showing preparation sequence:
- Auto-generated handoff document appearing with bullet points
- Calendar automatically blocking return meetings
- Task delegation happening with smooth animations
- Out-of-office setup completing with green checkmarks
Maria watches with growing confidence. Interface feels intelligent and supportive.

SHOT 3 (Vacation Montage - 15 seconds):
- Maria in Poland with her parents at dinner table, laughing, phone face-down
- Walking through beautiful old European town architecture, completely present, golden hour lighting
- Autumn leaves, warm colors, relaxed expression, no work visible
- Return to desk: Teams showing "5-minute briefing ready" from PULSE
- Clock shows 10:00 AM, she's smiling with coffee, caught up already
- Final shot: She's confidently booking ANOTHER vacation for March, clicking Submit with smile

Color grading: cool anxiety → warm vacation vibes → healthy natural office light. Golden hour sunlight in vacation scenes. Joyful mood.

Voiceover: "Maria had 15 unused vacation days. Not because she didn't need rest. Because last time she returned to 400 emails and chaos. With PULSE's REST Engine, vacation prep is automated. Return is protected. She caught up by 10 AM. And booked another vacation."

---

SCENE 7: THE IMPACT (2:10-2:25)
Visual: Clean professional motion graphics on white/light background. Each metric appears sequentially with smooth animation:

1. "-30% Burnout Attrition" - appears with downward green arrow
2. "+40% PTO Utilization" - appears with upward blue arrow
3. "+50% Manager Effectiveness" - appears with upward trend line
4. "$5.4M Saved per 1,000 employees" - appears with dollar icon
5. "33X ROI - Year One" - appears large and bold as finale

Quick montage overlay showing real impact:
- Employee actually on beach vacation, smiling
- Manager and employee productive 1-on-1 conversation
- Someone logging off at 5:30 PM, healthy boundary
- Virtual coffee between remote colleagues, genuine laughter
- Person using blocked Focus Time, productive and calm expression

Clean typography, EPAM blue accent color, professional data visualization aesthetic. Confident mood.

Voiceover: "The impact? Thirty percent less burnout. Forty percent more vacation taken. Fifty percent better manager effectiveness. Five point four million dollars saved per thousand employees. Ten X ROI in year one."

- Trust-building colors (blue, white)

Cut to: Close-up of two diverse hands reaching out to help each other up. Soft warm lighting, background gently blurred. Human connection, caring but not invasive gesture. Text overlay: "This isn't Big Brother. This is care."

Mood: Trustworthy, secure, ethical. Clean corporate aesthetic with human warmth.

Voiceover: "Built with privacy at the core. You see everything about yourself. Your manager sees team patterns only. Never names. Never surveillance. This is care, not policing."

---

All system logos come together like puzzle pieces forming a cohesive whole with human heart icon at center. Satisfying assembly animation.

Mood: Feasible, smart integration, confidence-building. Technical but not intimidating.

Voiceover: "And it's built on what we already have. Microsoft Teams, DIAL, ELITEA, and EPAM's existing systems. No new surveillance. No new data collection. Just a new lens: a human lens."

---

SCENE 10: THE EMOTIONAL CLOSE (2:45-3:00)
Visual Sequence:

SHOT 1 (Direct Connection - 7 seconds): 
Slow motion close-up of person's face (diverse, relatable, 30s-40s) looking directly at camera. Beautiful soft portrait lighting (key light from 45 degrees). Genuine expression showing vulnerability but hope. Eyes convey they've been struggling.

Text slowly fades in over face: "Imagine if someone at work actually noticed you were struggling."

Pause (2 seconds, face continues, slightly hopeful).

New text: "And said something."

Mood: Intimate, vulnerable, deeply human connection. Time slows down. Emotional weight.

SHOT 2 (PULSE Heartbeat - 4 seconds):
Return to Microsoft Teams interface. PULSE bot icon glows warmly in the sidebar, pulsing gently like a heartbeat. The heartbeat animation is subtle but alive. Camera slowly zooms into the heartbeat pattern.
