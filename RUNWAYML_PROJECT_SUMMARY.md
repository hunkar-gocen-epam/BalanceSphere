# 🎬 PULSE Project Summary for RunwayML
## Crazy Effective 1-Page Pitch for Video Generation

---

## 🎯 THE HOOK (30 seconds to capture attention)

**The Setup:**
Imagine you're a project manager looking at your dashboard. Every metric is green. JIRA: ✅ On track. Radar: ✅ Healthy. Staffing: ✅ Allocated. Your team is delivering.

**The Twist:**
Meanwhile, one of your developers has been coding until 1 AM for three weeks straight. Another team member hasn't taken vacation in 18 months because they're terrified of the chaos waiting when they return. A third person hasn't had a real conversation with a colleague in a month.

**The Problem:**
**"The project was Green. The person was Yellow."**

EPAM has 16+ systems tracking work. Zero systems watching people.

## 💡 THE IDEA (What we built)

### **PULSE: The Invisible Safety Net**

PULSE is a personal AI wellbeing companion that lives in Microsoft Teams and does what every burned-out employee wishes someone would do:

**Notice. Care. Act.**

It's not another portal. Not surveillance. Not a wellness app you forget to check.

It's the colleague that actually notices when you're drowning—and says something before it's too late.

---

## 🔥 HOW IT WORKS (The Three Engines)

### **1. LOAD Engine: "Who's drowning?"**
- **What it sees:** Your calendar shows 38 hours of meetings (team average: 25). GitHub shows commits at 1 AM. Slack shows you're responding on weekends.
- **What it does:** Reaches out proactively: "Your PULSE score is 67/100—elevated for 3 weeks. Want to explore options?"
- **The magic:** It doesn't just alert. It offers help. "Block focus time? Draft a message to your manager? Use a recovery credit?"

### **2. REST Engine: "Can you actually rest?"**
- **The problem:** Maria has 15 unused PTO days. Not because she doesn't need rest—because last time she returned to 400 emails and three angry clients.
- **What it does:** Before vacation: auto-generates handoffs, delegates tasks, notifies stakeholders. During vacation: batches non-urgent items, logs decisions. On return: "5-minute briefing: 2 decisions made, 3 kudos, 1 question. Nothing's on fire."
- **The result:** Maria books another vacation in March.

### **3. BOND Engine: "Are you connected?"**
- **What it sees:** Alex hasn't attended a social event in 6 weeks. No informal chats. No virtual coffees. Isolation creeping in.
- **What it does:** Surfaces missed kudos. Suggests low-pressure connection opportunities. Matches for virtual coffee with people with shared interests.
- **Why it matters:** Prevents isolation before it becomes loneliness.

## 🎭 THE HUMAN STORIES (Emotional Core)

### **Story 1: Arjun's Burnout Prevented**

**Before PULSE:**
- All dashboards: Green ✅
- Arjun: Working until 1 AM, 45-hour meeting weeks, declining social events
- Manager: Completely unaware until Arjun quits

**With PULSE:**
- PULSE sees the pattern after week 3
- Reaches out privately to Arjun: "I notice some concerning patterns. Want to talk?"
- Manager gets anonymous alert: "1 team member showing elevated signals"
- They have a real conversation. Workload shifts. Arjun takes 3 recovery days.
- **8 months later:** Arjun is still here. Leading the next project.

**Cost of losing Arjun without PULSE:** $150,000 + 6 months of tribal knowledge
**Cost of PULSE intervention:** One conversation + 3 days off

### **Story 2: Maria's Vacation Liberation**

**The Fear:**
Maria dreads her own vacation. Last time she returned to:
- 400 unread emails
- 3 missed escalations  
- 2 angry clients
- 1 week to recover

**With PULSE REST Engine:**
- **Before:** Auto-handoff doc generated. Dependencies mapped. Stakeholders notified.
- **During:** Inbox protected. Decisions batched. Phone actually off.
- **Return:** "5-minute briefing ready. You're caught up by 10 AM."
- **Result:** Maria actually rests. And books another vacation.

**The bigger win:** 15 unused PTO days become 0. Maria stays. Culture shifts.

---

## 🔒 THE TRUST FACTOR (Why this isn't creepy)

### **Privacy Firewall:**

**Employee sees:**
- Full PULSE score breakdown
- Every data signal used
- Complete control over sharing
- Option to pause anytime

**Manager sees:**
- "1 team member elevated" (NO NAMES)
- Team workload patterns
- Suggested systemic fixes
- NEVER individual surveillance

### **The Rule:**
PULSE is **opt-in, employee-owned, and never linked to performance reviews.**

It's care, not policing. Patterns, not surveillance.

---

## 💰 THE BUSINESS CASE (Why EPAM leadership cares)

### **The Problem in Numbers:**
- **EPAM:** ~30,000 employees globally
- **Industry burnout rate:** ~18% leave due to burnout annually
- **Cost per replacement:** $150,000 (recruiting + lost productivity + training)
- **Annual burnout cost:** $27M per 1,000 employees

### **The PULSE Impact:**
- **30% reduction** in burnout-related attrition
- **40% increase** in PTO actually used (healthier teams)
- **50% improvement** in manager effectiveness on wellbeing
- **Annual savings:** $5.4M per 1,000 employees
- **Phase 1 investment:** ~$165K

### **ROI: 33X in Year One**

---

## 🛠️ THE FEASIBILITY (Why this is actually possible)

### **Built on What We Already Have:**

PULSE doesn't require new surveillance or data collection. It reads signals from:

**Existing EPAM Systems:**
- Calendar (meeting load)
- JIRA (task velocity)
- GitHub/Copilot (commit patterns)
- Slack/Teams (communication patterns)
- Staffing (allocation changes)
- Vacation/Time Portal (PTO usage)
- People Portal (profile updates)
- Radar (project health)

**The AI Layer:**
- DIAL (EPAM's own AI platform)
- ELITEA (existing ML capabilities)
- Microsoft Graph API (Teams integration)

**The Interface:**
- Microsoft Teams (where work already happens)
- No new app to install
- Feels like a caring colleague, not a tool

### **Technical Architecture:**
```
Microsoft Teams (User Interface)
         ↓
   PULSE AI Layer (DIAL/ELITEA)
         ↓
Existing EPAM Systems (Data Sources)
```

**Time to MVP:** 3-6 months
**Time to pilot:** 6-9 months with 100-500 employees

## 🎬 VIDEO PRODUCTION NOTES

### **Tone:**
Professional but deeply human. Corporate but caring. Technical but emotional.

Think: Apple product launch meets TED Talk meets "This is Us" emotional storytelling.

### **Pacing:**
- Fast at the beginning (problem urgency)
- Moderate in the middle (solution clarity)
- Slow at the end (emotional landing)

### **Music:**
- Starts: Introspective, slightly tense (piano + strings)
- Builds: Hope emerging (strings crescendo)
- Ends: Inspiring, call-to-action (full orchestra but not overwhelming)

### **Key Scenes to Nail:**
1. **The contrast:** Green dashboards vs. exhausted person (0:10-0:20)
2. **PULSE reach-out:** Bot appearing warmly in Teams (1:00-1:10)
3. **Arjun's success:** 8 months later, leading a meeting (1:45-1:50)
4. **Maria's vacation:** Actually resting, phone down (2:00-2:05)

## 🚀 THE ASK (What we want to achieve)

**Immediate:**
Win the Wellbeing Ideathon and secure funding for MVP development

**Short-term (6 months):**

**The emotional journey:**
Recognition → Empathy → Hope → Inspiration → Commitment

**The intellectual journey:**
Problem clarity → Solution understanding → Feasibility belief → Business case acceptance → "We need to build this NOW"

**The ending feeling:**
