# The Problem

### "The Project Was Green. The Person Was Yellow."

**What Everyone Sees — EPAM's 16+ Systems:**

All systems showing ✅ GREEN:
- 📊 RADAR - Project on track
- 📋 JIRA - Sprint velocity healthy  
- 📅 STAFFING - Resources allocated
- 🔭 TELESCOPE - Skills updated
- 👤 PEOPLE PORTAL - Profile complete
- 🏢 DELIVERY CENTRAL - Client healthy

**What Nobody Sees:**
- 😰 Arjun: Coding until 1 AM for 3 weeks
- 😔 Maria: Carrying all presales work (untracked)
- 😶 Alex: No informal conversation in 4 weeks
- 😟 Jordan: Dreading "vacation" — fears return chaos

# The Root Cause

### The 8 Invisible Pressures

| Pressure | What It Looks Like |
|----------|-------------------|
| 🔥 **Load** | Chronic overwork, unrealistic timelines |
| 🧠 **Cognitive** | Fragmented focus, context-switching |
| 🚧 **Boundary** | Can't disconnect; "always on" |
| ⚖️ **Fairness** | Uneven workload; silent overperformers |
| 👻 **Visibility** | Hidden work; no recognition |
| 🔄 **Continuity** | PTO feels unsafe; return chaos |
| 🏝️ **Social** | Remote isolation; loss of belonging |
| 🔀 **Integration** | Life/work can't blend; guilt |

- 📋 8 tasks in progress simultaneously

**Your PULSE: 🟡 67/100**
